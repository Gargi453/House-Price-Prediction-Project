# House-Price-Prediction-Project
The House Price Prediction Project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices based on various factors such as median income, house age, number of rooms, population, and geographic location. Using the **California Housing Dataset**, the project involves preprocessing data, handling missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature correlations. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, with **XGBoost Regressor** used for model training. Evaluation metrics like **RÂ² Score** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** help assess the model's performance. Finally, the results are visualized using scatter plots to compare actual vs. predicted prices. This project is useful for real estate market analysis and can be further improved through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
